# BeamMP-linux-setup
little script for debian ( use apt package manager ) for build and install BeamMP on linux
for fedora, I make an attempt, make a pr if it's doesn't work, 
after the build, you can add it to lutris or other launcher, or make a .desktop

For the Arch version of this script, you can run into a SSL certificate error, downgrade to the V3.110 ca-certificates-mozilla (https://archive.archlinux.org/packages/c/ca-certificates-mozilla/), that's may be a solution.
