# BeamMP-linux-setup
little script for debian ( use apt package manager ) for build and install BeamMP on linux
The arch version aren't good now, some bugs I have on my Arch, so IDK if the script is not good or If my Arch linux are a little bad 
after the build, you can add it to lutris or other launcher, or make a .desktop
